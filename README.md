# French-English Language Flash Cards
## Project Overview:
Developed in Python, this language learning Flash Card game utilizes powerful features such as Pandas for data manipulation, file read-write operations,
loops for seamless interactivity, and the dynamic Canvas and Tkinter for a user-friendly interface.


## 💡 Project Features:
🔄 Randomized Learning: The game presents users with a random letter from the French dictionary sourced from french_words.csv.

🌐 Customizable Learning: Feel free to enhance your vocabulary by substituting your own french_words.csv file, allowing for exploration of different 
languages or topics.


## ⏳ Wait Limit:
To enhance the learning experience, a customizable wait period (default 10s, adjustable via the variable WAIT_PERIOD) is in place. After this time, the English translation of the presented word is revealed.
## 👉 User Options:
Choose 'X' Button: Get a new random French word for continued learning. 

Choose '☑' Button: Remove the current word from future flash cards, store it in a new CSV (wordsLearned.csv), and receive a new random French word.
